Intsllation guide:
1. Download Anaconda 3.7 version (if you are comfortable with 2.7 go for it, beginners start with 3.7) at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2. Installing Anaconda:
For Windows:
install the .exe file which was downloaded
For Linux:
in terminal, go to the directory in which the .sh file was downloaded, and type the following:
bash ./<Downloaded filename>
For macOS:
install the .pkg file which was downloaded
-You should now be able to find 'anaconda navigator' somewhere in your machine.
-Open anaconda navigator and install spyder/jupyter notebook (if already not installed). Once installed, codes in python can be written in these interfaces.
To open these interfaces, open terminal/anaconda prompt and type:
spyder / jupyter notebook

3. Libraries:

In general the way to install libraries in python is by opening terminal/anaconda prompt and type:
conda install <library name>
OR
pip install <library name>

For example, to install the library matplotlib:
conda install matplotlib
OR
pip install matplotlib

Recommended: numpy, opencv-python, scipy, matplotlib

If your OS is not supporting the new versions of above libraries, you can install old versions like : pip install opencv-python==4.0.0.21


3. Importing libraries
Even though while installing opencv we used the name opencv-python, while importing we use cv2

import cv2           # The OpenCV library for opening and saving images
import numpy as np   # Array manipulations and other math stuff
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # plotting graphs

4. Using Libraries


# reading the image in grayscale format
img = cv2.imread('barbara.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

cv2.imshow('original image', img)
cv2.waitKey()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Convert to normalized floating point
out = cv2.normalize(img.astype('float'), None, 0.0, 1.0, cv2.NORM_MINMAX) 
img_org = out.copy();
